# Open-Intelligence

Tools to process security camera (<b>any camera</b>) motion triggered images and sort seen objects (labels) in different categories. 
Inserts data into Postgresql database for further processing. For now mostly crafted based on different tutorials.

Goal is to make this fairly easy to setup and powerful so.. say goodbye to privacy.


### Installing

I am later making installation more automatic but for now, 
here's steps to get environment running.

###### Python side
1. Download Python 3.6 ( https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-amd64.exe ) 
2. Install dependencies, list is below
3. Run `Setup.py` OR Download <b>YOLOv3-608</b> weights, cfg, coco.names https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
4. Extract weights, cfg and coco to `models` folder
5. Download Postgresql ( https://www.postgresql.org/ )
6. Rename `config.ini.tpl` to `config.ini` and fill details
7. Separate camera and folder names with comma just like at base config template

###### Api side
1. Go to `/api` folder and run `npm install`
2. Install Postgresql server: https://www.postgresql.org/
3. Rename `.env_tpl` to `.env` and fill details.
4. Run `node intelligence.js` or with PM2 process manager.
5. Access `localhost:4300` unless port modified at .env file. 


#### Dependencies list

Install all following dependencies using console.
I have sectioned requirements for different levels.
 
```
# App requirements
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pillow
pip install opencv-python  (I have 4.1.2.30)

# Person requirements
...

# Car requirements
pip install openalpr
```  


#### Project folder structure

#### Postgresql notes

All datetime fields are inserted without timezone so that:

```
File     : 2020-01-03 08:51:43
Database : 2020-01-03 06:51:43.000000
```

Database timestamp need's to be shifted later to your local timezone. I have that +2 hours difference.


#### Openalpr notes

Got it running with following works.
Downloaded `2.3.0` release from here https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/releases

1. Unzipped `openalpr-2.3.0-win-64bit.zip` to `/libraries` folder
2. Downloaded and unzipped `Source code(zip)`
3. Navigated to `src/bindings/python`
4. Run `python setup.py install`
5. From appeared `build/lib` moved contents to project `libraries/openalpr_64/openalpr` folder.
6. At license plate detection file imported contents with `from libraries.openalpr_64.openalpr import Alpr`

Now works without any python site-package installation.



#### Trouble shooting
Got `ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.` ???  
=> try `import cv2`, not working -> packages missing, vc redistributable etc?  
=> Windows Server for example requires desktop experience features installed.


#### Todo

Here's some ideas

- [x] implement usable **base** structure;
- [x] basic api for serving small static statistics/status web page 'command center';
- [ ] license plate recognition from normal camera images;
- [ ] person/face recognition from normal camera images;
- [ ] possibility to train model... maybe coming;
- [ ] possibility to detect persons, car owners from sub result folders;
- [ ] camera microphone access and speech to text conversion tools;
- [ ] automatically analyse microphone -> text contents -> find interests;
